This is a plugin for Qmmp (1.6.0 or greater) which supports V2M file.
(V2 Module Player File)

The following packages are required, including development headers,
which some vendors split into separate packages:

- qmmp
- qt5

To build, run Qt5's qmake (often installed as qmake-qt5) and then build
with make:

$ qmake-qt5

$ make

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Qmmp's input plugin directory.  To install
to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/staging
